# Digital System Design
I designed a 4-bit adder using the DE10-lite FPGA board. The core of this project was to implement an adder circuit that could handle 4-bit binary numbers. To achieve this, I utilized 8 switches on the FPGA board, where 4 switches were assigned to each of the two inputs, allowing users to manually set the binary values for addition.
The result of the addition operation, which is a 5-bit sum, was displayed using 5 LEDs on the board. This visual representation was crucial for verifying the accuracy of the addition process. To further enhance the functionality, I integrated the output with two 7-segment displays to show the result in Binary-Coded Decimal (BCD) format. This step involved converting the binary sum into its BCD equivalent, which provided a more human-readable format of the result.
The task required meticulous coding in VHDL to ensure proper interaction between the switches, LEDs, and 7-segment displays. I had to manage the input handling, perform binary addition, and ensure that the result was accurately represented on both the LEDs and the 7-segment displays. This project not only demonstrated my ability to design and implement digital circuits but also highlighted my proficiency in VHDL coding and FPGA hardware management.
